"Redux is a predictable state container for javascript apps"

- Not tied to React -> it's for javascript
- Stores the state of your application
- All state transitions are explicit and possible to keep track of them

"Why react + redux?"

- Keeps state out of the individual components and communicates only with the components it needs to

"Do we really have a problem?"

- React context - prevents prop drilling
- useContext + useReducer - does the same thing as redux

"React-Redux is the official Redux UI binding library for React"

- Use react-redux if you are also using react, otherwise just redux is fine
